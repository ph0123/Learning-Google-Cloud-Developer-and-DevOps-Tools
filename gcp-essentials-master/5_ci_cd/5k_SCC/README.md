# Secuirty Command Center for GCP

## What is this?  

This is a security management and data risk tool for GCP resources that helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats from a single pane of glass.  Cloud SCC helps you identify misconfigured virtual machines, networks, applications, and storage and act on them before they damage your business. Cloud SCC has built-in threat detection services, including Event Threat Detection, that can quickly surface suspicious activity or compromised resources. You can also use it to reduce the amount of time it takes to respond to threats by following actionable recommendations or exporting data to your security information and event management (SIEM) system.
