# Google Cloud Armor

Google Cloud Armor provides DDoS and application layer defense working in conjunction with external HTTP(S) load balancers. It provides visibility into attacks and allows you to deploy pre-configured and custom rules to mitigate attacks against your web applications and services. Like the external HTTP(S) load balancer, Google Cloud Armor is delivered at the edge of Google's network, helping to defend against infrastructure and application attacks close to their source.

## Cloud Armor includes WAF Rules

- Google Cloud Armor helps you protect your GCP deployments from multiple types of threats, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and application attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi) using security policies which are implemented as WAF (web application firewall) rules
- Google Cloud Armor features some automatic protections and some that you need to configure manually
- The service includes example rules which can act as an WAF layer of protection with your GCP NLB
