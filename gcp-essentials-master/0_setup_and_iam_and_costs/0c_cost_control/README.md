# GCP Cost Control

Cost management is an important skill set for using GCP services. Effective cost control is implemented via a set of practices, patterns and tools.  Increasingly, GCP includes tools for this topic.  Shown below is a good starting point - an example of the GCP Billing Console.

## Some Key GCP Pricing Features

Google offers pricing features that help its users manage and reduce their cloud costs:
- Flexible Payment Charging Cycles - more at [link](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-cycle)
  - **Monthly** - for invoiced or self-serve billing cycle types
  - **Threshold** - when your account spend reaches a pre-defined level (for self-serve cycle types)
- For Many Services (check documentation to verify which services are included).
  -  **Sustained-use discounts** ‚Äî up to 30% off for workloads that run for most of the billing month on GCP services
  -  **Committed-use discounts** - up to 57% off if users commit to use an instance for a certain time period, with no upfront payment and with the flexibility to change instances during the commitment period - more at [link](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/cud-analysis) - report view example shown below
- For Google Compute Engine instance (VMs)  
  -  **Preemptible VMs** ‚Äî up to 80% off for Virtual Machines (GCE instances) that they can be shut down at any time and replace with others
  -  **Per-second billing** ‚Äî Google charges per second, which can add up to major savings when instances are frequently started and stopped.
  -  **Customizable machine types** ‚Äî this feature lets users configure their own machine configurations. This can translate into significant savings if you need a machine with stronger capabilities, but the high-end instances offered by other providers are not an exact fit.
- For Google Cloud Storage buckets (file/blob storage)
  - **NearLine or ColdLine storage tiers** -  for archived data, which are significantly cheaper than ordinary storage and offer fast access.
